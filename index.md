# About me

I am a computer scientist working in the field of bioinformatics.

My main interest is to develop methods for solving concrete biological problems.
At present, I am particularly focused on the assembly and analysis of (meta)genomes, using data obtained with the latest sequencing technologies.

In my free time I enjoy programming, running, playing piano.


# Short bio

I studied Computer Science at the University of Udine (Italy) and earned a PhD in 2016.
Under the supervision of [Alberto Policriti](http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~alberto.policriti/), I worked on methods for *de novo* genome assembly and approximate sequence alignment.

During my PhD, I also contributed to the *Spruce Genome Project* for the assembly of the first draft sequence of the 20-Gbp *Picea abies* genome. 
I adapted the assembly reconciliation tool I was developing in order to cope with the huge amount of data produced and to improve assembly's quality.

After the PhD, I started a postdoc at Sorbonne Universit√© (Paris, France). I worked on methods for protein domain annotation and functional characterization 
in the Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology, under the supervision of [Alessandra Carbone](http://www.ihes.fr/~carbone/).

Since February 2020, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) in the [Sequence Bioinformatics](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/sequence-bioinformatics/) team, under the supervision of [Rayan Chikhi](http://rayan.chikhi.name).
My current research project consists in the development of novel methods to identify and reconstruct individual genomes of highly similar bacterial strains in metagenomes.
